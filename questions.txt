16. I really like how Prolog can take information from a dataset in order to solve rules that
    are defined by the user. The rules that are created are very simplistic and yet the program
    was able to display semi-complicated information as a result.I also like how user-friendly Prolog is, 
    it took me the least amount of time out of all the labs because of this.

17. For some reason Prolog really fits with how my mind works, so I actually really enjoyed programming 
    in it; however, the only thing that I did not like was having to upload my file everytime I added
    a new rule. Sometimes it took me awhile to realize why my program was giving me an error until I 
    realized I had not uploaded my edited file.

18. I really enjoyed this lab. I found it extremely interesting and the only hard part for me was thinking
    conceptually how to define the rules I was making. Other than that, this lab was a lot of fun!

19. Between 5 and 7 hours. 

20.There may be a time I use Prolog again. I think it would be useful if I was working with datasets
   that need to talk to each other and/or are have related information that Prolog would easily be able
   to decipher through and produce clarity.
